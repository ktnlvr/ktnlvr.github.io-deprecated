    <h1>Kittenlover's Rooftop</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Artur Roos (pronounced "ro:s").
        This is my personal space and rather minimalistic online presence. This
        website includes a blog, a listing of my personal projects, my up-to-date CV
        and else. I do programming and contract work. Currently an active IB Student.
        Located in Joensuu, North Karelia, Finland. Fluent in English (IELTS C1).
        My spare time is spent learning about programming
        languages and linguistics in general, hacking away at my pet-projects, cooking,
        gaming and sometimes reading. Experienced in C/C++ and Python3.X, interested in Rust.
        I use arch btw.
    </p>

    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        I don't really specialize, during my time I've tried many different paradigms
        and fields, the most fun I had while doing Language Design & Graphics
        Programming related work. These are the technologies I would call myself confident
        with in no particular order:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>C/C++:</b> C89/99/11, Cpp11/14/17/20/23, STL, entt, Dear ImGUI, glfw, glm, gtest, benchmark, boost.asio</li>
        <li><b>Python3.X:</b> sqlalchemy, FastAPI, Flask, requests, bs4</li>
        <li><b>Rust:</b> serde, sqlx, actix-web, tokio, russh</li>
        <li><b>Databases:</b> SQLite3, MongoDB</li>
        <li><b>Misc:</b> GNU/Linux, git, Hugo, OpenGL, Vulkan, LaTeX</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I am also capable of writing Java, JavaScript and C#, but I don't work
        with them as often. 
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
        Look at the projects I am proud to show off here <a href="/projects">here</a>. 
        I started programming as a side thing in 2017 in 5th grade as a hobby, but 
        refused to attend any programming groups in my hometown. Around 2019
        programming took on a more important role in my life due to my increasing
        interest in mathematics. Most of the project I've done over the years
        will be never see the light of day, since I did not bother myself with
        keeping a comprehensive log of what I have and have not done.
