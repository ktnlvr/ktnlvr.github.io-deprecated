# Projects

This is my listing of projects I am proud to talk publicly about. My actual projects probably span dozens of languages (I quite like experimenting) and thousands of line of code never to be seen by another human being. Most of them are locked behind 403 for most, but these are actually great. The date describes when the first commit to the project was made. I only recently started taking care of my portfolio, so that's what the gaps are about. As previously descsribed, these are just the honourable mentions in no particular order.
